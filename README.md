# Athena Prolog

This project provides a comprehensive Prolog engine implemented in Scheme, offering a robust wrapper for embedding logic programming capabilities directly within Racket and various Scheme environments. It is designed for seamless integration, allowing developers to leverage Prolog's powerful pattern-matching and backtracking features alongside the flexibility of a functional programming language.

## Features

  - **Full Prolog Engine**: Implements a core Prolog engine with support for rules, facts, and queries.
  - **Seamless Scheme Integration**: Define Prolog predicates using Scheme procedures and evaluate Scheme code from within Prolog.
  - **Interactive Querying**: Use the `?-` macro for running interactive Prolog queries directly in your REPL.
  - **Debugging Tools**: Includes spy functionality for tracing predicate execution.
  - **Cross-Implementation Support**: Compatible with multiple Scheme standards (R6RS/R7RS) and implementations:
    - Racket
    - Gambit
    - Chez Scheme
    - Gauche
    - Sagittarius
    - Chibi Scheme
    - Guile
    - Chicken Scheme

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use this library, include the appropriate wrapper for your Scheme implementation from the `src/` directory:

- **Racket**: Use `src/prolog.rkt`
- **R7RS implementations**: Use `src/prolog.sld`
- **R6RS implementations**: Use `src/prolog.sls`

For development, use the Nix flake to set up an environment with all supported Scheme implementations:

```bash
nix develop    # Enters shell with all Scheme interpreters
```

Try Athena online at [https://tani.github.io/athena](https://tani.github.io/athena).

### Quick Start

To start running queries, you can use the interactive `?-` macro. Hereâ€™s how you can define a simple knowledge base and query it:

```scheme
(import (prolog))

;; Define facts
(<-- (parent john mary))
(<- (parent susan mary))

;; Run a query to find the children of mary
(?- (parent ?x mary))
```

This will output:

```
?x = john
Continue ? (y/n) y
?x = susan
Continue ? (y/n) n
```

## API Reference

### Defining Clauses

  - `<-`: Defines a new Prolog clause.
  - `<--`: Defines a clause, removing any existing clauses for the same predicate with the same arity.
  - `define-predicate`: Defines a new predicate using a Scheme procedure.

### Running Queries

  - `?-`: Executes an interactive query and displays solutions.
  - `run-query`: A programmatic way to run queries.
  - `solve`: Executes queries with callback-based solution handling.

## Built-in Predicates

The engine provides a rich set of standard built-in predicates for control flow, arithmetic, list manipulation, and term testing.

| Predicate | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `(true)` / `true` | Always succeeds. |
| `(fail)` / `fail` | Always fails. |
| `(!)` / `!` | The "cut" operator. Commits to all choices made so far and prunes other alternatives. |
| `(if ?test ?then ?else)` | If `?test` succeeds, executes `?then`; otherwise, executes `?else`. |
| `(if ?test ?then)` | If `?test` succeeds, executes `?then`. |
| `(not ?goal)` | Negates a goal. Succeeds if `?goal` fails, and fails if `?goal` succeeds. |
| `(and ?goal1 ...)` | Succeeds if all sub-goals succeed. |
| `(or ?goal1 ...)` | Succeeds if any sub-goal succeeds. |
| `(repeat)` / `repeat` | Creates a choice point that will always succeed on backtracking. |
| `(= ?x ?y)` | Unifies term `?x` with term `?y`. |
| `(== ?x ?y)` | Succeeds if terms `?x` and `?y` are structurally identical, without performing unification. |
| `(is ?result ?expr)` | Evaluates a Scheme expression `?expr` and unifies the result with `?result`. |
| `(lisp ?result ?expr)` | Evaluates a Scheme expression `?expr` and unifies the result with `?result`. |
| `(lisp ?expr)` | Evaluates a Scheme expression `?expr` without unifying the result. |
| `(atom ?x)` | Checks if term `?x` is a Prolog atom (a non-variable symbol). |
| `(atomic ?x)` | Checks if term `?x` is an atomic value (i.e., not a variable or a pair). |
| `(var ?x)` | Checks if term `?x` is an unbound variable. |
| `(ground ?x)` | Checks if term `?x` is fully instantiated with no unbound variables. |
| `(number ?x)` | Checks if term `?x` is a number. |
| `(member ?elem ?list)` | Succeeds if `?elem` is a member of `?list`. |
| `(append ?list1 ?list2 ?list3)` | Succeeds if `?list3` is the result of appending `?list1` and `?list2`. |
| `(maplist ?pred ?list1 ...)` | Applies `?pred` to corresponding elements of one or more lists. |
| `(findall ?template ?goal ?results)` | Collects all solutions for `?goal` that match `?template` into the list `?results`. |
| `(bagof ?template ?goal ?results)` | Groups solutions of `?goal` by the bindings of any free variables and collects the corresponding `?template` values into `?results`. |
| `(dynamic-get ?name ?var)` | Retrieves the value associated with the dynamic variable `?name` and unifies it with `?var`. |
| `(dynamic-put ?name ?value)` | Sets the value of the dynamic variable `?name` to `?value`. |

## Debugging

The Prolog engine includes a simple spy functionality for debugging.

  - `current-spy-predicates`: A parameter that holds a list of predicates to spy on.
  - **Spy Commands**:
      - `l` (leap): Continue execution without spying.
      - `c` (creep): Step through the current goal.
      - `n` (nodebug): Disable spying.

## Development

### Testing

Run tests across all supported Scheme implementations:

```bash
make all
```

Test specific implementations:

```bash
make racket      # Test with Racket
make gauche      # Test with Gauche  
make chicken     # Test with Chicken Scheme
make chez        # Test with Chez Scheme
make guile       # Test with Guile
make chibi       # Test with Chibi Scheme
make sagittarius # Test with Sagittarius
make gambit      # Test with Gambit
```

### Code Formatting

Format all source and test files:

```bash
make format      # Format using schemat
```

### Building for Web

Build the Gambit version for web deployment:

```bash
./script/build.sh
```

### Git Hooks

The project uses lefthook for automated code formatting:

```bash
lefthook install # Install git hooks (runs automatically after setup)
```

Git hooks will automatically run `make format` before each commit and stage any formatting changes.

### Clean

```bash
make clean       # Remove log files
```

### Testing Framework

Tests use SRFI-64 (Scheme Testing Framework) with implementation-specific test runners:
- **`test/test.scm`**: Main test suite with core and library tests
- **`test/test.7.scm`**: R7RS test runner
- **`test/test.6.scm`**: R6RS test runner
- **`test/test.rkt`**: Racket specific tests

## Architecture

The project is organized into several key components:

- **`src/prolog-core.scm`**: Core Prolog engine implementation (highly commonized)
- **`src/prolog-lib.scm`**: Standard library predicates
- **`src/prolog.sld`**: R7RS library wrapper with conditional compilation
- **`src/prolog.rkt`**: Racket-specific wrapper  
- **`src/prolog.sls`**: R6RS library wrapper

The core engine handles:
- **Unification**: Variable binding and term unification
- **Backtracking**: Choice points implemented using exceptions and continuations
- **Clause Database**: Dynamic predicate storage with arity-based indexing
- **Built-in Predicates**: Standard Prolog predicates (arithmetic, control flow, list operations)
- **Debugging Support**: Spy/trace functionality with configurable indentation
